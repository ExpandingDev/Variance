# Variance

Variance is a Python 3 tool to autogenerate weightlifting programs and meal plans.

This is by no means a complete tool, or built by any medical/fitness professional.
This is basically a side project for me to learn more about weightlifting while also contributing to open source, and also hopefully creating a time saver in the future for myself and others.
